## Features

* Based entirely on [HTML5 boilerplate](http://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate). 
* Comes with d3, underscore, jquery-ui and MathJax. 
* Includes useful datasets, such as polygons for the world-countries
  and united states. 
* The latest jQuery via CDN, with a local fallback.
* rm is your friend. Remove anything you don't need. 

## Contributing

Anyone and everyone is welcome to contribute. 

### Current TODOS
* Find more useful datasets to include. Zip codes? Time zones? 
* Try to scale MathJax down some. Only the SVG components are used, so
  everything else can fall away. 
* Create a better example for the index.
