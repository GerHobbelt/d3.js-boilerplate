# d3.js Boilerplate

d3.js Boilerplate is a template designed to help you build a
sophisticated data driven document as fast as possible. 

## Quick start

### Get the template
* Clone - `git clone git@github.com:zmaril/d3.js-boilerplate.git`
* Rename - 'mv d3.js-boilerplate my-ballin-document'

### Develop locally
* Move 'cd my-ballin-project'
* Host 'python -m SimpleHttpServer'
* Navigate to localhost:8000


### Deploy Globally 
* Host - 'heroku create my-ballin-document --stack cedar' 
* Commit - 'git commit -am "Tots my goats"'
* Push - 'git push heroku master'

## Features

* Based on [HTML5 boilerplate](http://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate). 
* Comes with d3, underscore, jquery-ui and MathJax already loaded in. 
* MathJax allows you to display latex as your labels (via
  foreignObjects). 
* Includes useful datasets, such as polygons for the world-countries
  and United States. 
* rm is your friend. Remove anything you don't need. 

## Contributing

Anyone and everyone is welcome to contribute. 

### Current TODOS
* Find more useful datasets to include. Zip codes? Time zones? 
* Try to scale MathJax down some. It's huge. Only the SVG components are used, so
  everything else can fall away. 
* Create a better example for the index graph.
